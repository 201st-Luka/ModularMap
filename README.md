# ModularMap

---

This Minecraft mod is a map mod. 
The goal of this modification is to provide a map that is modular and can be customized to the player's liking.

The mod is at an early stage of development and is not yet ready for use, but you can follow the progress on this page.
The mod should also implement an API to communicate with other child mods in the future, but at the moment it is not 
the part that is focused working on.

## Features

Not yet released, so it is difficult to say what features will be available in the first version.

## Planned features

Here is a list of planned features

- [ ] World map (fix rendering issues/bugs)
- [ ] World map available after restarting the game
- [ ] Customizable waypoints
- [ ] Ability to select another map to be used (useful if the server has multiple IPs or if the server map was 
  tested on a client and uploaded to the server, so all progress is kept)
- [ ] Configuration menu
- [ ] Server integration (ability to synchronise the map to other clients that play on the same server using this mod)
- [ ] API for other (child) mods (such as a minimap, a seed map, a chunk debugging tool, etc.)
